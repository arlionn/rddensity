### RDDENSITY

The rddensity package provides Stata and R implementations of manipulation tests employing local polynomial density estimation methods. This method is useful for falsification of Regression Discontinuity Designs, as well as for testing for self-selection or sorting in other contexts. This implementation provides hypothesis tests and bandwidth selectors for manipulation testing.
